# EvoGenAlg
Fiddlin with evolution based genetic algorithms

## Description:
I've been interested in philosophy and understanding intelligence for quite some
time now.

I try stuff, try to figure out how they work, why it makes sense for the way
they work. Understand behaviour, predict behaviour.

Anyway, long story short, one of the things I have is a model (or an image of
one) of the reality I perceive, including the entities within them.

My goal with this project is to basically take a top-down approach of how I
see intelligence of sorts emerge out simple rules and systems that ever increase
in complexity and detail.
Not only do I learn from the system, but I hope to introduce new logic into the
system so that It can grow and learn as well.

As of this moment of writing. I've already achieved a very rough and ham-fisted
approach to create an eco system of entities that have some form of genome and
that can create and/or take 'life'.

## Working example:

You should be able to see a working copy of the current status,
here: https://Terrub.github.io/EvoGenAlg/

## Usage:
Just go the working example and you may have to click a button of sorts that
implies the sense of beginning or start.

That's it.

You should see a canvas with a dark grey background that is dotted with squares
in different colours and sizes that seems to move around pseudo-randomly.
* The colour of a square is composed of the current value of a specific trait.
 * The red channel is represented by the trait: Strength.
 * The green channel is represented by the trait: Speed.
 * The blue channel is represented by the trait: Size.

### Traits:
Each entity has a number of traits, these started of as just a few but will
most likely expand more rapidly in the future. By hand at first and hopefully
automatically second.
