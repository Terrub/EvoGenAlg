    Rules is a bit of a separate beast. It should describe the rules that define
    the project on a very abstract level.

    I'm looking at defining things like conservation of energy here. Possible
    interactions that occur or how they occur. Like momentum and friction and...
    well, just anything physics really.

    If a world object loads in these rules it should be able to resolve or
    collapse the rules into something renderable in some way or another.
