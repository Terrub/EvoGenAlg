    This is the world object. (Might want to rename?)
    This is where the ruleset is loaded up into and applied on the entities that
    live here.

    Like plotting a formula. The ruleset is the formula. the entities are the
    data points and the colours of each data point.
    The world object then dictates how many data points are visible in the
    current world frame/viewport and runs the datapoints through the formula to
    get the actual display data that needs to be sent to the display object.
